#  Regula Document Reader (Ionic version)
Regula Document Reader SDK allows you to read various kinds of identification documents, passports, driving licenses, ID cards, etc. All processing is performed completely  _**offline**_  on your device. No any data leaving your device.

You can use native camera to scan the documents or image from gallery for extract all data from it.

We have provided a simple application that demonstrates the  _**API**_  calls you can use to interact with the Document Reader Library.

## How to build the demo application
1. Get a trial license for demo application at  [licensing.regulaforensics.com](https://licensing.regulaforensics.com/)  (`regula.license`  file).
2. Download or clone current repository using the command `git clone https://github.com/regulaforensics/DocumentReader-Ionic-Plugin.git`.
3. Run the following commands in Terminal:
```bash
$ cd DocumentReader
$ npm install
$ ionic cordova prepare
```

4. Android:
  * Copy the `regula.license` file to the `DocumentReader/platforms/android/app/src/main/assets` folder.
  * Run `ionic cordova build android`, then`ionic cordova run android` inside `DocumentReader` folder - this is just one way to run the app. You can also run it directly from within Android Studio.

5. iOS:
  * Add the `regula.license` to the target.
  * Run `ionic cordova build ios`, then `ionic cordova run ios` inside `DocumentReader` folder - this is just one way to run the app. You can also run it directly from within Xcode.

## How to add the SDK to the project
Document Reader libraries are available on [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/~regula).
First of all, install **API** library, simply running the following command:
```bash
$ ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-document-reader-api --variable CAMERA_USAGE_DESCRIPTION="To take photo" --variable READ_EXTERNAL_STORAGE="To choose photo"
```

And then add one of the [Core](https://docs.regulaforensics.com/cordova/core) libraries depend on the functionality that you wish and the license capabilities, e.g.:

```bash
$ ionic cordova plugin add cordova-plugin-document-reader-core-fullrfid
```
